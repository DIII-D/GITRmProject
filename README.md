# GITRmProject - gmsh_automated_scripts

Hi User!
As part of the effort to automate the workflow of DiMES local impurity transport simulations at DIII-D using the GITRm transport code,
we propose a tool that generates meshes for simple DiMES geometries using the gmsh Python API. 
This user-friendly tool allows anyone to easily simulate their preferred DiMES setup without 
the need to manually draw and mesh the geometry each time.

# Dependecies

This package was tested using pyhton version >= 3.10, gmsh version 4.13.1 and requires the math package

# Build

This package was built using poetry (more on that here: https://python-poetry.org/)
